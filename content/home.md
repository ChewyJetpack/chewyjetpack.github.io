I'm a designer, programmer, musician, and hardware-tinkerer from London. 

Professionally, I've spent over a decade in both design and front-end development, and have worked for global brands such as Google, Sony, eBay, Nokia, Virgin, and Tinder.

Outside of my professional life, I'm usually designing and building physical devices such as music equipment, reading or writing about technology, or producing electronic music.
