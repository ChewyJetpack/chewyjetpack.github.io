I'm a senior product designer who builds products that solve real problems for users. Over 15+ years, I've led design teams with 100% retention rates, established user research programs, and built design systems serving 200+ brands. My approach combines deep user understanding with technical implementation - I can code the solutions I design when needed.

Outside of work, I'm a music producer with releases on established drum & bass labels and an active visual artist involved in London's creative community. I volunteer at [The Crib](https://thecrib.org.uk/) youth charity in Hackney, where I run a weekly community music studio.
