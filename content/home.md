I'm a senior product designer with 15+ years building scalable digital products. I've led design teams with 100% retention rates, established user research programs, and built design systems serving 200+ brands. My approach combines systematic design thinking with technical implementation - I can code the solutions I design when needed.

Currently available for senior product design and consulting roles with companies doing interesting, meaningful work.

Outside of work, I'm a music producer with releases on established drum & bass labels and an active visual artist involved in London's creative communities. I volunteer at [The Crib](https://thecrib.org.uk/) youth charity in Hackney.
