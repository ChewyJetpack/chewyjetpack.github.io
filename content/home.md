I'm a designer, programmer, musician, and hardware-tinkerer from London. 

I've spent over a decade in both design and front-end development, and have worked for global brands such as Google, Sony, eBay, Nokia, Virgin, and Tinder. 

Nowadays I manage design teams and digital products, with a focus on building and scaling design systems, human-centred design principles, and deep collaboration with engineering teams.

Outside of my professional life, I'm usually designing and building physical devices such as music equipment, reading or writing about technology, or producing my own electronic music.
