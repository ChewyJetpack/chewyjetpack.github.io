I think “Creative Technologist” is more descriptive than a list of frameworks and buzzwords (<a href="CV.pdf" target="_blank">check out my CV</a> if that’s what you’re into). In a nutshell, I’m into tech and art. At the intersection of the two is design, so that’s where I've spent most of my career. 

Outside of work, I'm an artist. I've been writing and producing original music since childhood, and I run a youth studio in Hackney once a week at [The Crib](https://thecrib.org.uk/); a young people's charity which is run by some incredible people.
