I like working on problems that sit between disciplines - where user research meets technical constraints, where design systems need to actually work for developers, where business goals have to make sense for real people.

Whether that's modernising 24-year-old platforms, building systems that scale across hundreds of brands, or establishing research programs from scratch, I love on solutions that actually work in context.

Here are some recent projects that show how I approach different types of problems.
