title: Senior Product Designer

I solve complex design problems systematically, often moving between strategy, design, and technical implementation. Recent projects include modernising a 24-year-old platform while keeping millions of users happy, building design systems that scale across 200+ brands, and establishing research programs that revealed completely wrong assumptions about international user bases.

My background spans both design and development - I spent my first decade building complex web applications, which means I understand how to create solutions that actually work in practice and can collaborate effectively with engineering teams.

I work best on challenging projects that require figuring things out from first principles, whether that's user research, design systems, or platform rebuilds. I'm particularly interested in education, arts organisations, or mission-driven companies, though I'm open to any compelling creative and technical challenges.
