I've spent over a decade in both design and front-end development, and have worked for global brands such as Google, Sony, eBay, Nokia, Virgin, and Tinder. 

Nowadays I manage design teams and digital products, with a focus on building and scaling design systems, human-centred design principles, and deep collaboration with engineering teams.
