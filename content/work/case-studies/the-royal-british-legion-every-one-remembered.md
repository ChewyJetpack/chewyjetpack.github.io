summary: >-
  Every One Remembered was a campaign undertaken by the Royal British Legion,
  with the goal of commemorating each and every soldier who died in WW1, through
  user-generated commemorations, within one year, leading up to the 2018 Poppy
  Appeal.


  The result was a web app, affording people the ability to place poppies on an interactive map, in the locations where soldiers were lost or buried, sharing memories and photos relating to each soldier.
background: Based on a database of 1,060,174 soldiers, users were able to search
  through names, regiments, and locations to find lost relatives or discover
  those who may have been forgotten, and “remember” them, by way of placing a
  poppy on an interactive map, leaving a short commemoration and uploading
  photographs.
method: I designed the site in collaboration with an external agency and
  integrated the RBL Boilerplate. I also worked on refining the UX of the site
  through testing and reworking various user flows to drive commemorations. This
  included the addition of features such as 'bulk commemorations', giving users
  a simple way to commemorate a soldier's comrades once they have finished
  commemorating that soldier. This proved extremely effective in driving
  conversions by repeatedly out-bounding users from the commemoration process
  into an optional bulk commemoration. By October 2018, all soldiers had been
  remembered!
