meta_description: A collaboration between Three and Tinder on a campaign concept
  where Henry VIII used Tinder to find his wives
summary: >-
  Three and Tinder had developed a collaborative campaign concept where King
  Henry VIII used Tinder to find his wives. We needed to create an interactive
  promotional experience that would drive Samsung Galaxy S9 competition entries
  while representing both brands.


  I was responsible for the concept development, visual design, and front-end implementation of the interactive experience.

  I developed "The Swipe is Right" - a mini-game where users operated a Henry
  VIII-themed version of Tinder, swiping through his six wives and guessing
  their fates (survived, beheaded, or divorced) by swiping in the correct
  directions.


  The visual design bridged Three's bold brand with Tinder's interface patterns, unified through Tudor-era imagery. I built the experience in Vue.js with smooth swiping animations, working alongside a backend developer handling the Laravel integration for competition entries.


  The game allowed unlimited retries to maximize conversion rates while guiding users naturally toward the competition entry form.

  The campaign achieved strong engagement metrics:

  * **76% of page visitors** engaged with the interactive game
  * **54% overall conversion rate** to competition entry
  * Campaign reached millions of users
wrap-up: >-
  This was a straightforward interactive campaign that worked well because the
  game mechanics tied directly to both brands - Tinder's swipe mechanism and
  Three's "phones make everything better" message. The high conversion rates
  showed that when the user experience flows naturally, the business metrics
  follow.


  *The campaign success led to discussions about future collaborative projects.*
