meta_description: Creating Vue.js kiosks, promotional films, and brand materials for NewsNow's literary festival partnership
summary: >-
  NewsNow was the principal partner of the 2019 Folkestone Book Festival. The challenge: represent a news aggregator at a literary festival without being boring.

  
  My solution involved custom Vue.js kiosks running on Raspberry Pis, displaying live news feeds alongside a promotional film I wrote, produced, and scored myself. The film used the theme "There's more than one way to see things" as both a visual puzzle and a statement about media plurality.
background: >-
  The festival theme was "The Shape of Things to Come"—fitting for 2019, with Brexit uncertainty, climate protests, and other divisive political shifts dominating the news cycle. This aligned perfectly with NewsNow's mission to encourage wide reading and informed perspectives on complex issues.
goals: Beyond supporting Folkestone's creative industry, our goals were to elevate NewsNow's brand identity and demonstrate our values of media plurality and public-interest journalism through high-quality brand materials that would engage festival-goers.

  ## The Technical Challenge

  
  I designed and built a bespoke Vue.js web app displaying live headlines and imagery across multiple topics, pulling directly from NewsNow's API. The challenge: making this work reliably in a public venue with questionable internet.

  
  Solution: Raspberry Pi units with offline fallbacks and robust error handling. I handled everything from display specifications to physical installation.

  
  ## The Creative Challenge

  
  For the promotional film, I presented a concept that leaned into the divisive political climate of 2019. My approach: illustrate extreme polarisation, then present NewsNow as an antidote to binary thinking.

  
  The resulting slogan: "There's more than one way to see things."

  
  ## The Production Challenge

  
  With an extremely tight timeline, I took on the entire production myself:
  - Writing and storyboarding  
  - Sourcing stock footage that didn't look obviously like stock footage
  - Creating the musical score (15+ years of music production finally paid off)
  - Editing and colour correction

  
  All whilst managing the Vue.js development and technical setup.

  
  ## The Design Challenge

  
  For the print advertisement, I created a 3D isometric shape that appeared as different 2D shapes when viewed from each axis—a literal visualisation of "there's more than one way to see things."

  The film was well-received by organisers and attendees—classes of school children applauded in the auditorium. It became a reference point for subsequent discussions about NewsNow's brand identity.

  
  We'd created reusable assets and processes for future events. The technical infrastructure worked flawlessly, and the creative approach established templates for brand communications.

  
  The project demonstrated that NewsNow could engage meaningfully with cultural events whilst staying true to our mission of promoting informed discourse.

wrap-up: >-
  Two weeks to write, produce, score, and deliver a complete brand campaign whilst building the technical infrastructure to support it.

  
  Sometimes constraints force the best creative solutions.
