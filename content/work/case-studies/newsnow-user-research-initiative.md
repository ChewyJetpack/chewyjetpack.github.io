meta_description: How I conducted NewsNow's first user research in 25 years, surveying 6000+ users across three continents
summary: >-
  After 25 years, NewsNow was flying blind. They had millions of users but were making fundamental assumptions about who these people actually were. That's a problem when you're planning major product changes.

  
  So I built the company's first user research programme from scratch. The scale ended up being bigger than expected—6000+ survey responses across the UK, US, and Nigeria, plus moderated interviews with users ranging from corporate executives to teenagers on 3G connections.
background: >-
  Twenty-five years of product decisions had been based on A/B test results, voluntary feedback, and educated guesses from the engineering team. But we were planning the largest redesign in the company's history. Flying blind wasn't an option anymore.
goals: >-
  I had three clear objectives:

  
  1. **Identify who actually uses NewsNow** - demographics, motivations, contexts
  2. **Test our new design concepts** with real users before launch  
  3. **Build research capabilities** that would outlast this single project

  
  The challenge was doing this for a global platform with no existing research infrastructure, no user database, and no established relationship with our community.
method: >-
  ## The Survey: Going Big to Go Deep

  
  I launched a site-wide demographic survey targeting random users, covering everything from basic demographics to news reading habits and how NewsNow fit into their daily routines.

  
  The response was overwhelming: over 6000 completed surveys within weeks.

  
  ## The Discovery: Three Platforms, Not One

  
  When I analysed the data by geography, something fascinating emerged. We weren't serving one global user base—we were serving three completely distinct communities:

  
  **UK users:** Older demographic, desktop-focused, politics/business news  
  **US users:** Mixed age groups, mobile-heavy, broader interests  
  **Nigerian users:** Younger, mobile-only, sports/entertainment focused

  
  Each segment had narrow demographics that didn't match general online news consumption. We were serving specific niches, not broad audiences.

  
  ## The Interviews: Real People, Real Insights

  
  I recruited participants representing all key segments for 30-minute recorded sessions. The conversations revealed how NewsNow actually fit into people's lives—from competitive intelligence to sports updates on limited data plans.

  
  Instead of static mockups, users tested our working staging site built in Vue.js with real data. This caught complexity that prototypes would have missed. 


  Once all the interviews were complete, I worked with the design team to create a summary of our findings, as well as a highlights reel, containing the most interesting and useful clips of our interview recordings, grouped into categories, to offer colleagues and management a quick glimpse into the responses of our participants.
results: >-
  The research fundamentally changed how NewsNow made product decisions. Key discoveries:

  
  - Our "global" platform was actually three distinct regional products
  - Users weren't anti-change, they were anti-losing-functionality  
  - Mobile usage patterns varied dramatically by geography
  - Power users had sophisticated workflows we'd never documented

  
  The insights directly informed our redesign strategy. Instead of choosing between modern and classic designs, we built both. We established ongoing research as core capability, moving from assumptions to evidence-based design.
