  Coravin is a US based start up, offering an innovative product which enables
  people to pour wine from the bottle without removing the cork, using a
  specialised needle to pierce the cork and replace the lost volume of wine with
  compressed argon gas.


  After designing a number of campaign materials for Coravin, they enlisted BPL Marketing to design and build a number of international brochure websites to showcase their products in markets in which they donâ€™t operate an eCommerce business. 


  I designed the entire brochure site in way that I felt showcased the product effectively.


  The site is based on a Wordpress back end, and uses npm to build front end assets
