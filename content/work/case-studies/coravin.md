summary: Coravin needed international brochure websites for markets where they
  didn't operate e-commerce. As a startup with limited brand guidelines, the
  brief was to represent their technical wine preservation innovation within a
  luxury lifestyle context while helping refine their digital brand identity as
  they expanded internationally.

  Working as the sole designer, I was responsible for translating their minimal
  brand materials into cohesive web experiences that would work across multiple
  international markets.


  With limited brand guidelines to work from, I focused on clean, sophisticated layouts that emphasized product photography and the premium wine experience. The design approach balanced explaining the technical innovation with lifestyle imagery that positioned wine preservation as part of an elevated drinking ritual.


  I created modular page templates that could accommodate different languages and regional requirements while maintaining visual consistency across markets.
results: Successfully launched cohesive brand presence across multiple
  international markets. The visual design approach I developed became reference
  points for Coravin's continued brand development and provided templates for
  efficient expansion into additional markets.
wrap-up: >-
  This project was a good exercise in luxury brand design with minimal
  constraints. Working with a startup meant having creative freedom to establish
  digital brand patterns, while the international scope required thinking about
  scalability from the start.


  *The design templates continued to be used as Coravin expanded into additional markets.*
