  Coravin is a US based start up, offering an innovative product which enables
  people to pour wine from the bottle without removing the cork, using a
  specialised needle to pierce the cork and replace the lost volume of wine with
  compressed argon gas.


  After designing a number of campaign materials for Coravin, they enlisted BPL Marketing to design and build a number of international brochure websites to showcase their products in markets in which they donâ€™t operate an eCommerce business. 


  Coravin was in relatively early stages of brand development, so we had limited informaiton in the way of brand guidelines. I designed the site to reflect the brand's luxury connotations, with a focus on imagery and interactivity.
