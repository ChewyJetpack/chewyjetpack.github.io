meta_description: Creating international brochure websites for Coravin's wine preservation technology across multiple markets
impact: >-
  Established Coravin's digital brand identity during a crucial growth phase, creating scalable design patterns that supported rapid international expansion and became reference points for continued brand development.
summary: >-
  Coravin had developed ingenious wine preservation technology in the form of a needle system that lets you pour wine without removing the cork, using argon gas to replace the volume. 
  

  Working with minimal brand guidelines for a startup still finding its visual identity, I created sophisticated web experiences that balanced technical credibility with premium wine culture.

method: >-
  The challenge was translating minimal brand materials into cohesive web experiences for markets where Coravin didn't operate e-commerce - places where the websites needed to build brand credibility and drive retail partnerships rather than direct sales.
  

  My approach focused on clean, sophisticated layouts that let product photography tell the technical story whilst lifestyle imagery positioned the product in a cultural context. The design had to explain complex technology without feeling clinical.
  

  I created modular page templates that could accommodate different languages and regional requirements whilst maintaining visual consistency. This scalability was crucial for a startup planning rapid international expansion.
results: >-
  Successfully launched cohesive brand presence across multiple international markets. The visual design approach I established became reference points for Coravin's continued brand development and provided efficient templates for expansion into additional markets.
  
  
  The design patterns helped define Coravin's digital brand identity during a crucial growth phase when they were still establishing their market position.
wrap-up: >-
  This project was a valuable exercise in luxury brand design with creative freedom. Working with a startup meant establishing digital brand patterns rather than following rigid guidelines, whilst the international scope required thinking about scalability from day one.
  
  The design templates continued to be used as Coravin expanded into additional markets throughout their growth phase.
