summary: NewsNow is a news aggregation platform with a lot of unique
  characteristics. Launched in 1996, the platform has undergone constant
  development in its over-25-year history. The business is fundamentally driven
  by two core disciplines; editorial and engineering, and thus while the
  platform is functionally impressive and extremely useful, it was in much need
  of a design overhaul.
