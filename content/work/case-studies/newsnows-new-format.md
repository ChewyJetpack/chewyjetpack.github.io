meta_description: Redesigning a 24-year-old news platform serving millions whilst keeping loyal users happy
summary: >-
  I inherited a 24-year-old news platform that looked like it was built in 1997. Because it was. The challenge wasn't just making it look modern—it was doing that without breaking workflows that millions of users relied on daily.

  
  My role: designer, front-end developer (Vue.js), user researcher (company's first in 25 years), and product strategist working directly with CEO/COO.

background: >-
  Here's what I walked into: a platform unchanged since the early 2000s, serving millions of users daily, with zero user research in its 25-year history. But people loved it. Any significant change risked alienating the very people who made the platform valuable.
goals: >-
  Make NewsNow look and feel contemporary whilst preserving what users loved about it. That meant modern visual design, accessibility compliance (WCAG AA), and building a flexible foundation for future features. Most importantly, maintaining compatibility with feature phones globally—many users were browsing on Opera Mini with extreme data saving.

  ## The Research Breakthrough

  
  I surveyed 6000+ users across three continents and discovered we weren't serving one user base—we were serving three distinct communities with completely different needs. UK users, US users, and Nigerian users had different age distributions, device usage, and content interests.

  
  Key insight: Users weren't resistant to change—they were terrified of losing functionality.

  
  ## Design Strategy: Choice, Not Compromise

  
  Instead of forcing one design on everyone, I created multiple layout modes:
  - **Card View:** Modern, image-heavy for newcomers
  - **Classic View:** Original list density for power users  
  - **Compact View:** Ultra-high density for headline scanning

  
  This was NewsNow's first time hosting images after decades of text-only headlines.

  
  ## Technical Implementation

  
  I rebuilt the front-end in server-side rendered Vue.js whilst maintaining the existing Perl backend. The challenge: modern development experience whilst supporting Opera Mini on feature phones globally.

  
  Solution: Progressive enhancement and CSS feature queries to serve appropriate experiences without breaking anything.
methodImages: []
results: >-
  User satisfaction metrics improved steadily throughout rollout. The design system enabled rapid iteration on new features, and the Vue.js architecture made development faster and more predictable.

  
  Most importantly: successful launch with positive feedback from both new users and power users who could access their preferred workflows.

  
  The research programme became an ongoing capability that informed all subsequent product decisions.
