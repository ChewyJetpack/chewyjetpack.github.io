intro: >-
  I'm a creative and highly technical design lead, with over 10 years'
  experience delivering everything from high profile marketing campaigns for
  global brands such as Google, eBay, Sony, Nokia, Virgin, and Tinder, to
  iterative product design and development for large-scale, digital publishing
  businesses. 


  I have a product-centric approach, enabling me to make pragmatic, strategic, big-picture decisions, whilst my expertise in both design and engineering affords hands-on involvement with designers, researchers, and engineers, for a holistic implementation of the entire product lifecycle.


  I have built and scaled successful product design teams, design systems, and user research initiatives to inform both design and product decisions. I'm also up-to-date with the latest development tools and best practices; I have a soft spot for Vue.js, and clean, modular SCSS.

For over a decade I've been a professional designer and front end developer. Nowadays I mostly manage design teams, working on large-scale digital products, developing and scaling design systems, conducting user research, and defininng road maps. In the past, I've worked on everything from creative agency work for global brands (Google, Sony, eBay, Nokia, Virgin, and Tinder, to name a few) to ground-up, front-end refactoring projects, and large-scale web-app builds. I have a passion for human-centred design, clean and scalable code, and the implementation of both to solve complex problems in a holistic way.
