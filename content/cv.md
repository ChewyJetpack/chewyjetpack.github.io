For over a decade I've been a professional designer and front end developer. Nowadays I mostly manage design teams, working on large-scale digital products, developing and scaling design systems, conducting user research, and defininng road maps. In the past, I've worked on everything from creative agency work for global brands (Google, Sony, eBay, Nokia, Virgin, and Tinder, to name a few) to ground-up, front-end refactoring projects, and large-scale web-app builds. I have a passion for human-centred design, clean and scalable code, and the implementation of both to solve complex problems in a holistic way.
