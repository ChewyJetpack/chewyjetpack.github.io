Outside of work, I am a passionate electronic music producer, maker, and father. Over the years, Iâ€™ve had several releases on well-known drum & bass labels, such as the seminal imprint Renegade Hardware, as well as my own label. I have more recently completed building a custom, battery-powered music production studio in a box, and am now turning my attention to digital signal processing and embedded audio systems, with the goal of designing and building DIY electronic instruments.
