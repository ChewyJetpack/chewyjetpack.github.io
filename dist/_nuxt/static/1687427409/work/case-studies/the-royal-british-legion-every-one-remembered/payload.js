I also worked on refining the UX of the site through testing and reworking various user flows to drive commemorations. This included the addition of features such as 'bulk commemorations', giving users a simple way to commemorate a soldier's comrades once they have finished commemorating that soldier. This proved extremely effective in driving conversions by repeatedly out-bounding users from the commemoration process into an optional bulk commemoration. By October 2018, all soldiers had been remembered!",toc:[],body:{type:c,children:[]},dir:"\u002Fwork\u002Fcase-studies",path:"\u002Fwork\u002Fcase-studies\u002Fthe-royal-british-legion-every-one-remembered",extension:d,createdAt:a,updatedAt:a}}],fetch:{"data-v-1241c6a6:0":{contact:{slug:"contact",title:"Emil Smith",email:"hi@emilsmith.pro",socialLinks:[{url:"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.linkedin.com\u002Fin\u002Femil-smith\u002F"},{url:"https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002FChewyJetpack"}],toc:[],body:{type:c,children:[]},dir:"\u002F",path:"\u002Fcontact",extension:d,createdAt:a,updatedAt:a}}},mutations:void 0}}("2023-06-22T09:46:44.787Z","Designing an interactive digital experience to remember every soldier who died in WW1","root",".md")));
