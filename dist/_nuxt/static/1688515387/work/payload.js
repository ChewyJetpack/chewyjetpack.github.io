As with any long-term project, especially one that had started life in 1997, sooner or later a refactor becomes necessary. In this case, refactoring the design was equally as important as refactoring the codebase. Additionally, there were plans to develop large improvements to the product’s functionality, which would necessarily disrupt aspects of both the codebase and the design. The existing design was simply not flexible enough to accommodate these new developments, meaning that the product was in need of a fresh coat of paint, and maybe a slight rethink of the walls and foundations underneath, on which these new features could be built.\n\nBeyond this, there was scope for a larger redesign, using the initial reskin as a foundational starting-point. The New Format, as we called it, would be a large undertaking, with many stages of iteration and research.",goals:"The new design would need to give the product a much needed aesthetic lift, bringing the look and feel in line with contemporary standards. The design would also need to adhere to accessibility standards to ensure good usability, and while we set no rigid rule on WCAG accessibility standards, we aimed for AA accessibility where possible. The design would also need to be modular, flexible, and scalable, to accommodate new and complex features later on. \n\nFinally, due to the diverse nature of the userbase, specifically those in English-speaking countries in the developing world, the product would need to retain its high level of browser compatibility, offering an improved experience to people browsing on feature phones, using Opera Mini with extreme data saving enabled.\n\nOf course throughout this process it was vitally important to ensure that our updates were beneficial to NewsNow's extremely large, loyal, and long-standing user base.",goalsImages:[{src:"\u002Fimg\u002FNNnewFormat.jpg",caption:j}],method:"### Reskin\n\nBeyond the overall implementation and refactor of the codebase, we also tested rigorously to ensure a high level of browser compatibility. The site is fully compatible with Opera Mini on feature phones, bar certain customisation features, and user accounts. Additionally, I devised a new alternative to the existing device-detection system which relied heavily on javascript and resulted in a complex matrix of site versions that required individual support. This system used a combination of media queries and support queries in CSS to accurately identify the devices needing special support, and unified site versions for other devices which previously had to be catered for individually, resulting in a much more easily maintainable system.\n\n![NewsNow's brand palette](https:\u002F\u002Fmiro.medium.com\u002Fv2\u002Fresize:fit:2000\u002Fformat:webp\u002F1*GA0hYK7JtIrDuk1F1IaUkQ.png)\n\n### Research\n\nI took time to analyse the existing product in detail, speaking with members from all areas of the business, including development, editorial, and senior management, to get a full and comprehensive understanding of the business, the product, and the underlying technology.\n\nI felt it important to look at the product in the wider context of the industry, to see how we might want to position ourselves relative to other news aggregators, publishers, and social platforms. NewsNow is unique in this sense; it is a news aggregator that performs similar functions to those by the likes of Google, Apple, and Yahoo, but the number of individual topics and the number of headlines on a given page is more akin to the likes of social media platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter or Reddit. \n\nReddit, specifically, shares many parallels with NewsNow. Firstly, the Information Architecture is inherently similar: Long feeds of headlines, for a near-endless variety of topics, algorithmically sorted and able to be reordered by chronology, popularity, or relevance. In addition, Reddit had also recently embarked on a large redesign project, moving away from a dense, text-based layout that had accumulated a dedicated and loyal userbase, just like that of NewsNow. On the basis of these parallels, I embarked on a [competitor analysis project](\u002Farticles\u002Fposts\u002F2019-11-21-analysis-reddits-2018-redesign) of sorts, to understand the ‘what’, ‘why’ and ‘how’ of Reddit’s redesign, charting their roadmap, digging up metrics, some of which were kindly supplied to me by subreddit moderators, and drawing actionable conclusions which we were able to implement in our own redesign process. \n\nOnce the initial reskin was complete, I embarked on a proper [user research initative](https:\u002F\u002Femilsmith.pro\u002Fwork\u002Fcase-studies\u002Fnewsnow-user-research-initiative) to inform our larger redesign as part of the New Format. This helped to guide our product development process throughout the remainder of my time at NewsNow, and changed our position on crucial decisions, such as how to introduce imagery, whcih aspects of the existing layout were most important to our users, and what kinds of navigational tools were fundamental to the experience. In most cases, our assumptions were challenged, or outright disproved!\n\n### Roadmap\n\nEquipped with the learnings from my research phase, I worked with senior management to specify the scope and deliverables for the New Format, and within the development team to create a scope and task backlog for the technical requirements. We used Asana to manage the project, in which I constructed a set of timelines with clear dependencies between design and development, accounting for testing and refactoring, with a set launch date for our private, opt-in beta. We also took learnings from the Reddit case study to help inform our process, including the implementation of a system to manage user feedback, a public blog post to inform users of upcoming changes, and a staggered rollout to ensure feature-parity prior to the site-wide launch.\n\nThe nature of this project did not necessarily lend itself to a strict goal-setting framework, as it was not intended to drive any specific metric, though we did employ rigorous in-app feedback tools so that we could check user satisfaction metrics throughout the rollout. The success of the project would be measured in our resulting ability to scale and develop the product in the future, and the satisfaction of our dedicated core user base.\n\n### Design\n\nThe design strategy for this project employed the use of atomic design principles to create a modular, component-based design system in Figma, with standardised tokens for measurements, colours, and typography, and context-agnostic, BEM-style components for all UI elements, templates, and pages. The design would be carefully tested against WCAG accessibility guidelines to ensure that colour contrast ratios, font sizes, and interactive elements were sufficiently distinguished and usable.\n\nI worked closely with developers on the structure of the design system, since I would also be responsible for building a large proportion of the front end. We discussed stacks, tooling, and coding practices, and used those decisions to inform the kind of functionality we could include in the design. This cohesion between design and development is something I strive for in my work, and the result of this holistic approach is always hugely beneficial.\n\nThe most significant visual update to the site was the introduction of imagery. NewsNow had never hosted images before in all its decades of life, and this was a huge update to the overall user experience, especially considering the perspective of users who had been devotedly scouring through lists of plain text headlines for years. Interestingly, the results of our user research suggested that most users would be very satisfied with an image-heavy, grid-based layout. However, there was a clear segment who absolutely preferred the old list style. This led us to introduce a layout mode toggle, enabling users to customise the experience for themselves.\n\nFundamentally, the design would need to reflect NewsNow as a brand, which was a challenge in itself, since the business had not previously devoted much time to developing a formal brand identity. On this basis, I engaged with senior management over several brainstorming sessions to develop a preliminary brand guidelines document, which included the specification of brand values, identity, and ethos, as well as some visual elements such as typographic rules, a new colour palette, and logo guidelines. Of course, the visual aspects of this document were intended to be under constant evolution throughout the design process, the definition of the core brand values and identity was instrumental in subsequent design decisions.\n\n### Development\n\nImplementation of the new design was a months-long process for the development team at NewsNow. I was responsible for the majority of the front-end build, working closely with a full-stack software developer on migrating from NewsNow’s bespoke, in-house, Perl-based templating system to our new stack, consisting of Perl on the back end, with server-side rendered Vue.js, complete with state management, on the front end. This was a fantastic system to work with; SSR allowed us to preserve our SEO juice, and VueX enabled us to create a seamless experience, client-side. \n\nComponents were developed to mirror the structure of the design system, using BEM syntax and isolated component templates. We took time and care to evaluate and audit the existing code, selecting chunks for preservation, removal, or refactoring. Through this process we also identified features that had gone unused for months or years and were able to simplify the site functionality by pruning such features from the product. \n\n### User Engagement\n\nIn addition to the user research project bringing human-centred design into the operational process at NewsNow, we also made sure to engage users regularly throughout the rollout process.\n\nUpon completion of our initial reskin beta, I wrote up a [Medium piece, outlining our redesign](https:\u002F\u002Fmedium.com\u002Fnewsnow\u002Fwelcome-to-the-newsnow-redesign-925ccdf008f8) for our users. People who were offered the chance to take part in the beta were directed to this piece to read about the changes being made, the reasoning behind those changes, and the positive impacts those changes were designed to make. In addition, those who took part in the beta were prompted for NPS-style ratings of the new design and offered the opportunity to give in-app feedback, for which we guaranteed a response from the team. Through this feedback mechanic, we were able to assemble a research panel of loyal NewsNow users who agreed to take part in the upcoming research project ahead of the New Format.\n\nThroughout this process, we were able to gather valuable information which we used to iterate and improve on the design prior to our full launch, and it served as a valuable precedent for future research projects. We were also able to develop a previously absent rapport with our users; we responded to each and every piece of feedback we received, engaging directly with the people who used the product, and giving them the opportunity to contribute to the development of the product.",methodImages:[],results:"Overall it is no understatement that this project was a resounding success. It was well-received by both users and stakeholders and has enabled us to work on the NewsNow site more efficiently and effectively than was previously possible. Also, we embarked on some very large-scale design and development projects which have been facilitated by the new design system and its ability to evolve naturally and holistically with each update.\n\nAdditionally, the research and user-engagement measures undertaken within this project have helped to inform various subsequent projects, and paved the way for further rounds of user interviews, the development of user personas, and user demographic initiatives. User satisfaction metrics climbed steadily during my time at NewsNow.\n\nGiven the opportunity to do it again, I believe the project could have benefitted from a more thorough preliminary user research phase, to gather clear and identifiable pain points in the existing UX, and potentially free up some of the initial restrictions surrounding legacy styles and layout, by way of being able to make informed decisions and improve upon the existing formula. Further to this, I would have liked to have set OKRs from the outset, based on such knowledge, to better evaluate the outcomes of the project. \n\nThat said, NewsNow's New Format is by far the largest, most complex, and highest quality piece of work I've accomplished to date. It was a fantastic opportunity to rapidly and thoroughly expand my skills in UX, design, product management, and javascript development all at once, over the course of an intensive two years. \n\nThe New Format is still currently in private beta, but I hope it will launch soon.",toc:[],body:{type:a,children:[]},dir:e,path:"\u002Fwork\u002Fcase-studies\u002Fnewsnows-new-format",extension:b,createdAt:m,updatedAt:m},{slug:"newsnow-user-research-initiative",description:n,title:"NewsNow: User Research Initiative",hero:o,thumb:o,category:"UX Research",year:l,meta_description:n,summary:"During my role at NewsNow, I initiated and led a long-running user research initiative. Design methodology at NewsNow had traditionally been informed by engineering, along with A\u002FB testing paradigms and voluntary user feedback.\n\nThis project was a huge undertaking, consisting of design, prototyping, conducting surveys, analysis, and user interviews, and collating all of our learnings into both actionable tasks, and updated internal processes around the product lifecycle.\n\nNot only was this an incredibly eye-opening project, from speaking directly with users such as high-flying corporate professionals from the States, and 3G-wielding teenagers on the streets of Nigeria, to stretching the limits of what hi-fi prototyping is capable of, but it resulted in some fantastic learnings for the entire business.",background:"Existing understanding of the makeup of NewsNow’s userbase and their motivations had been inferred from A\u002FB test results for features over a span of many years, and while this served as a valuable starting point, it was far from concrete. \n\nThere was, however, a large appetite within the team, including senior management, editorial, and development team members, to better understand our users. Given this appetite, and a product roadmap brimming with large-scale design and development projects, it seemed right to make strides towards uncovering our userbase and giving our users a seat at the table. I put together a plan of action and advocated for human-centred design principles as part of a more efficient and effective product design and development process.",goals:"The purpose of this initiative was to introduce complementary, strength-based research and testing processes to lay the foundation of human-centred design principles and to facilitate a more effective product lifecycle in the future.\n\nMoreover, with a full product redesign in the works, we had a direct need to fulfil in terms of testing that design with real people, who were representative of our core userbase demographics. The problem was that we had very limited data on who our core userbase actually was, since no previous research had been done in the company's twenty-five-year history. \n\nThis resulted in a clear set of goals:\n\n1. Identify core readership demographics\n2. Test our new design with real people to ensure it was rock-solid before release\n3. Implement processes to facilitate further research",method:"The initiative was implemented via my own twist on Design Thinking methodology. The reason for not following the *Empathise, Define, Ideate, Prototype, Test* process to the letter was that the product was not yet in a state where it would have been conducive to iterative product design processes. We were mid-redesign, developing a new design system to pave the way for a more iterative workflow, but we needed to ensure that the new design was going to be well received by our users and that any major potential pain points could be worked out prior to release. \n\nMy resulting methodology went as follows: \n\n## Data-gathering\n\nThis initial phase was primarily a data-gathering effort. I launched a site-wide demographic survey to a randomly selected subset of users, asking broad questions about people’s interests, usage habits, age, gender, location, and general news reading habits, with the goal of identifying both the general demographic makeup of our existing userbase, as well as NewsNow's place within their news diet. The survey was implemented in Hotjar, and thus I was able to gather additional metadata for each submission, such as from which pages users submitted the survey and information about their device. In addition, Hotjar enabled me to collect responses from users who did not complete the full survey, which proved especially useful in looking for selection\u002Fresponse bias.\n\nIn addition to the survey, I also used Hotjar to generate a wide array of heatmaps, to look more specifically at how users on different topic categories might behave differently from one another.\n\nFinally, I was able to gather quantitative data from Google Analytics to further understand device\u002Fbrowser\u002FOS distribution, usage habits, and behaviour.\n\n## Analysis\n\nThe demographic survey generated approximately 6000 responses, which I exported as a CSV and processed in Google Sheets. I spent a long time sifting through all the responses, slicing the data in various ways, and looking for patterns that might help me to uncover segments within the userbase. As part of this process, I weighted the responses by geography, and device category, using the Google Analytics data from the period of time in which the survey was active as a source of truth from which to calculate weights that could be applied in combination to individual responses.\n\nUpon applying weights to the data and segmenting by country, I discovered a number of very clear segments within our userbase. Focusing on what were by far the three largest segments; UK, US, and Nigeria, I was able to identify vastly different distributions of age, topical interests, and device usage between the three groups. What was particularly interesting about this was that the demographics in each segment appeared somewhat narrow; we were appealing to specific age ranges and categories of interest in each country that were distinct from one another, and that appeared unlikely to be representative of online news readership demographics as a whole. To validate this, I referenced publicly available data regarding online news readership from [Ofcom](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.ofcom.org.uk\u002F__data\u002Fassets\u002Fpdf_file\u002F0024\u002F116529\u002Fnews-consumption-2018.pdf), [Pew Research](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.pewresearch.org\u002Ffact-tank\u002F2019\u002F09\u002F11\u002Fkey-findings-about-the-online-news-landscape-in-america\u002F), [Statista](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.statista.com\u002Fstatistics\u002F381569\u002Fleading-news-and-media-sites-usa-by-share-of-visits\u002F), and [SimilarWeb](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.similarweb.com\u002Ftop-websites\u002Funited-states\u002Fcategory\u002Fsports). \n\nBy checking our own data against these broader demographic insights, I was not only able to confirm the boundaries of our users’ segmentation but was also able to identify prominent demographics in the wider population, both in the UK and the US, that were underrepresented in the NewsNow userbase. \n\nBased on my analysis of the survey results, analytics data, and third-party data, I was able to craft a handful of personas, representative of our core users. In addition, based on the demographics I had found to be under-represented, I created additional personas, representative of our additional target demographics, with the goal in mind of better serving these demographics and subsequently growing and diversifying the NewsNow userbase. I created a full write-up of my findings, including my methodology, data and charts, sources, and a summary of the results, which I presented to the wider team. \n\n## User Interviews\n\nThe next step was to engage with real people, in person, and begin to build a rapport with the people behind our personas. Through our earlier demographic survey, and through dedicated research participant recruitment services such as UserInterviews.com, we were able to work with users that were representative of all our user personas, from a range of backgrounds; from the UK, US, and Nigeria.\n\nThe methodology for the interviews was based on a semi-structured interview format, which offered a relaxed atmosphere and an opportunity to build a rapport with participants, whilst still ensuring that all our talking points were covered. For the purposes of this round of interviews we had considered creating hi-fi Figma prototypes from our existing designs. However, NewsNow being an engineering-led business meant that we could do one better; we had a working staging site with real data, where our new design system had been implemented in Vue.js, and while it was far away from full feature-parity, it was leagues ahead of a Figma prototype.\n\nInterviews were conducted on Lookback.io, recording video, audio, and notes, and lasting approximately 30 minutes, for which users were incentivised with Amazon vouchers. I lead all the interviews, with a midweight UI designer observing and keeping notes. The process for each interview was to first understand a bit more about the participant; their interests, hobbies, news-reading habits, and a bit about their day-to-day life, to understand how our product might fit into their day. I would then show them the product, and ask for their first impressions and gut-feelings about the overall look, feel, and utility. Beyond that, participants were free to use and explore the product and were asked to try and vocalise their thoughts and actions as much as possible while they did so. I would answer questions, make notes of potential pain points, and occasionally offer some steer, either to ensure participants were able to cover all the talking points, or to help on the occasion that they got stuck with the prototype or the UX. At the end of each interview, I would sit down with our UI designer for a general recap, to discuss any points of interest, collate notes, and tag certain points of note in the recording. \n\nOnce all the interviews were complete, I worked with the design team to create a summary of our findings, as well as a highlights reel, containing the most interesting and useful clips of our interview recordings, grouped into categories, to offer colleagues and management a quick glimpse into the responses of our participants.",results:"The overall results of this initiative were enlightening, challenging, and extremely positive. For the first time, we were able to understand and empathise with the NewsNow userbase in a direct and immediate way. We were shown which parts of our new product were working well and in some cases even better than expected, as well as parts of the product that needed improvement. We were given a better understanding of how our product fit into the wider industry, how our users interpreted the brand against competitors, and how we might better serve a more diverse range of people in the future. \n\nWe also found that some of our initial expectations were challenged: There were certain areas of the new product which we had been intending to make personalisable, or using algorithms to modulate aspects of the UI based on the user segment being served, but in fact we found that our users harmonised on certain aspects of the design.  In the end, it seemed that by optimising the core areas of the product in-line with the needs of our users, we would negate the need for additional complexity. We were also able to re-prioritise our product roadmap and add more specificity to design tasks in the backlog based on these new insights.",toc:[],body:{type:a,children:[]},dir:e,path:"\u002Fwork\u002Fcase-studies\u002Fnewsnow-user-research-initiative",extension:b,createdAt:c,updatedAt:c},{slug:"newsnow-the-creative-folkestone-book-festival",description:p,title:"NewsNow: The Creative Folkestone Book Festival",hero:"\u002Fimg\u002Fhero-cf.jpg",thumb:"\u002Fimg\u002Fthumb-cf.jpg",category:"Branding & Design",year:2019,meta_description:p,summary:"NewsNow was the Principal Partner of 2019's Folkestone Book Festival.

That said, it was not without challenges to overcome.\n\nThe biggest challenge was the short film. Through our early concept meetings where various team members developed draft scripts, I presented a concept that leant heavily into the divisive political climate of the time. Given that NewsNow's brand identity is based in rationality, impartialism, and advocating media plurality, it can be difficult to position the brand in a way that really makes a strong statement. My solution to this was to harness inflammatory political issues, illustrate their extreme polarisation, and present NewsNow as an antidote to these binary extremes. This included coining the slogan \"There's more than one way to see things\".\n\nThe team decided to run with my script by a unanimous vote. The concept behind the piece is that of unity in the face of adversity. In a time when people seem most divided, and when polarisation appears to trump rational discourse, it’s important for us to recognise each other as human beings; to be understanding, and to take the time to appreciate nuance, complexity, and even chaos. By taking the time to see the world through the eyes of others, we can learn to appreciate those who see things differently, rather than reject them. This concept is not only something that I am personally passionate about, but it is representative of NewsNow’s fundamental purpose.\n\nInitially, we had planned to outsource the production to a video agency, but when deliberating over early storyboards and mockups, we collectively decided we weren't satisfied with the direction they were taking, and after some deliberation over our in-house capabilities, I put myself forward to produce the film. \n\nI had to produce the film within an extremely tight timeframe in the lead-up to the festival, whilst also balancing my work on the Vue.js kiosk design and build, print merchandise designs, and AV setup. Given these constraints, shooting our own footage was not an option, so we had to rely on editorial and stock footage. This meant hours upon hours of scouring Getty, iStock, and Shutterstock, to find footage that would complement the script without looking too obviously like stock footage. In addition, the film would run most of the time on our on-site kiosks, which would not have audio. This meant that while the script was written with the intent for it to be narrated, we instead had to trim it down and use synced captions.\n\nWith no narrator, the music became a crucial factor for the occasions when the film would be projected on stage with audio, and sourcing royalty free music that could effectively fit the progression of the script was near impossible. With 15+ years of music production under my belt, I ended up taking this on too! I took a rhythmic piece of stock music, added a chord progression and some additional percussion, bass, and effects, and evolved the piece to reflect the tone of our narrative.\n\nBeyond the film, the print advertisement I designed for the festival brochure was a highlight for me. I enjoyed the refreshing opportunity to work for print, which is something I've not had much opportunity to do in the past. Using the strapline from the video; \"There's more than one way to see things\", I designed a kind of visual puzzle. The core of the design is a 3D isometric shape, which would appear as a different 2D shape when viewed head-on from any one axis.

Classes of children, attending the festival on school trips, applauded in the auditorium at the end of the film, and it has since been a linchpin in subsequent discussions about NewsNow’s ethos and brand identity.\n\nHaving said that, I definitely felt the time-pinch, and I would have loved to have done things slightly differently. While I came up with the initial concept, I did also work closely with senior management during production to accommodate their feedback and contribuitions in my work, and while this would have been great with more time, the time constraints made it difficult to reconcile some ideas effectively. I also would have liked to spent more time on post production, colour correction, frame interpolation, and narration, which would have yielded a much more polished end product. \n\nOverall, the event was a great success. As a team, we had successfully created a set of reusable assets, skills, and processes with which to approach future events, and had developed a stronger brand identity both internally and in the eyes of event attendees.",resultsImages:[],"wrap-up":"",toc:[],body:{type:a,children:[]},dir:e,path:"\u002Fwork\u002Fcase-studies\u002Fnewsnow-the-creative-folkestone-book-festival",extension:b,createdAt:c,updatedAt:c},{slug:"three-vs-tinder",description:q,meta_description:q,summary:"During my role at BPL Marketing, we were approached by long-time client Three to produce a promotional landing page for their collaborative campaign with Tinder. The cmapaignwas titles \"Phones Are Good\" and the concept was based on juxtaposing smartphones with historical events, to explore comedic ways in which they might have turned out for the better. In this case, Three and Tinder had built a campaign around King Henry VIII using Tinder to find his wives. We were briefed to build an interactive, promotional landing page for their digital marketing campaign, funneling users to a competition entry form where they could enter for the chance to win a Samsung Galaxy S9.",method:"We set about conducting brainstorming sessions with the wider creative team, and settled on the concept of \"The Swipe is Right\"; a play on words from the old game show *The Price is Right* and of course Tinder's swipe feature.\n\nOur solution was an interactive mini-game in which users would operate a Henry-VIII-themed version of the Tinder app, swiping through pictures of his six wives. Players would need to guess which of his wives survived, or were beheaded or divorced, by swiping in the correct direction for each to reach the end of the game and access the competition entry page.\n\nUsing both Three and Tinder's existing brand guidelines and campaign assets, I created the logo for *The Swipe is Right*, as well as wireframes, hi-fi designs, and prototypes in Figma, to test with stakeholders before commencing development. During this time we also firmed up the specifications for the functionality, such as allowing users who made incorrect choices to restart the game as many times as they wanted, to encourage conversions. Other members of the creative team worked on copywriting and other messaging, as well as the ad campaign to drive traffic to the landing page.\n\nOnce we had the design nailed down, we decided to use Vue.js for the front end of the page, as it would afford a high level of interactivity and was very unopinionated compared to other JS frameworks available at the time. I built the front end, alongside a back-end developer working in Laravel to handle the data, API, and security.",date:"2022",title:"Three & Tinder: Phones Are Good",hero:"\u002Fimg\u002Fhero-sr.jpg",thumb:"\u002Fimg\u002Fthumb-sr.jpg",category:"SPA Design & Development",year:2017,summaryImages:[{src:"\u002Fimg\u002Fthree1_97da9f069a.jpg",caption:"Three vs Tinder: The Swipe is Right - State one"},{src:"\u002Fimg\u002Fthree2_49565f9441.jpg",caption:"Three vs Tinder: The Swipe is Right - State two"},{src:"\u002Fimg\u002Fthree3_ac8661b2d2.jpg",caption:"Three vs Tinder: The Swipe is Right - State three"},{src:"\u002Fimg\u002Fthree4_b3507a1ac1.jpg",caption:"Three vs Tinder: The Swipe is Right - State four"},{src:"\u002Fimg\u002Fthree5_113fa2fd61.jpg",caption:"Three vs Tinder: The Swipe is Right - State five"}],results:"Overall this project was a great success.
