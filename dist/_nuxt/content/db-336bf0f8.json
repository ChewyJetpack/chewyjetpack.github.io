It has since been updated to stand independently from that work.\n\nReddit is what is known as a “Social News Aggregator”. It combines the features of a social network with those of a news aggregator, to create a user generated, self-governed array of “communities” (otherwise known as “subreddits”). These communities are entirely moderated by volunteers, and serve as independent, topical pockets of the internet, for everything from memes, to politics, to the most niche, specialist subjects.\n\nPosts are sorted via “votes”, which allow redditors (users of Reddit) to collectively determine which posts rise to the top of any given community, based on their vote score. This system results in a kind of emergent aggregation, where individual redditors contribute to a larger system via small interactions, resulting in a colony-like behaviour that functions in a similar fashion to a software content aggregator, though more chaotic in nature."},{"content":"# The Company\n\nReddit was founded in 2005, by Steve Huffman, Alexis Ohanian and Aaron Swartz, backed by startup incubator Y Combinator, and subsequently bought in 2006 by Conde Nast Publications. In 2009, Huffman and Ohanian both left to pursue other projects, and in the following five years, reddit grew its user base dramatically, became independent from Conde Nast, operating as a separate subsidiary of its parent company Advance Publications, introduced sponsored content, and eventually raised $50 million in funding and spun off as an independent company. \n\nIn late 2014 and early 2015, Ohanian and Huffman re-joined as Executive Chairman and CEO, respectively. In 2017, Reddit raised $200 million in Series C funding to support a major redesign of the site and a new native video project."},{"content":"# Why Redesign Reddit?\n\nAfter Huffman and Ohanian left Reddit in 2009, no significant design work was undertaken before their return in 2014-2015. As a result, the design was dated and lacking in current, contextual design language that would make the site appealing for new users. This was bad for Reddit is a brand, bad for overall usability (the website was not adherent to modern best practices for usability and accessibility), and bad for any prospect of growing the userbase. In addition to this, the design did not cater well to mobile, and even senior leadership members referred to it as “dystopian Craigslist”. Additionally, Reddit claimed to be having trouble developing new features due to technical debt and an aged code base of 12 years.\n\nAside from these obvious cases for the redesign, it would be naive to assume there was not a high level of pressure from investors to more effectively monetise the platform. This would mean imbuing the new design with programmatic and native advertising, as well as looking for new ways to monetise the extensive user data available. I believe this factor is resposible for a lot of the turbulence Reddit saw during this process."},{"content":"# How to Redesign “The Front Page of the Internet”\n\n## [](<>)Design Process\n\n1. Build out a team of 70 to focus solely on the redesign, including a new director, 20 designers and 2 UX researchers, and of course, a whole lot of developer resource\n2. Visualise metrics for success, based on motivations for the redesign, within the context of the current website (these were not made public, though it is widely believed that these metrics would have been related to advertising revenue alongside userbase growth)\n3. Build on top of legacy rather than creating something entirely new, as this would be unfamiliar to users\n4. Start with a clearly defined perspective, but be ready to adapt and be open to the needs of your users\n5. Conduct user research, covering:\n\n   1. New user stories (“I don’t know what I’m looking at”)\n   2. Power user stories (“Why are you killing Reddit?”)\n   3. Hundreds of hours of video and interviews\n6. Build a new mobile app and use it as an opportunity to test a new look and feel\n7. Scope out a modernised web stack\n8. Develop multiple design concepts, spanning a range of styles\n9. Develop a new brand identity\n10. Test the new design concepts internally and externally, with users and non-users\n11. Gather qualitative feedback from as many sources as possible\n12. Decide on an overall direction for the stack, brand, and design\n13. Develop the basic foundations first: Information hierarchy, typography, UI components - this enables easy re-structuring of layouts and components in response to research or feedback\n14. Create a prototype of the new site, to about 30-40% functionality, to test development approaches and gather user feedback\n15. Conduct further interviews and prototype tests to get user impressions of the new design\n16. Rebuild or amend the prototype based on the above, as needed"},{"content":"## The Stack\n\n* Server: NGINX\n* Databases: PostgreSQL, Redis\n* Server-side framework: Node.js\n* Programming languages: JavaScript, Python\n* Front end: React and Typescript\n\n\n\nNew analytics stack, alongside new dashboarding system to visualize metrics and inform product and design:"},{"images":[{"src":"/img/stack.png","alt":"Reddit's tech stack"}]},{"content":"## Design Overview\n\nReddit’s redesign ethos was one of preservation as much as progression. Care was taken to identify existing user journeys and preserve those use cases through to the new website. Design language was borrowed from modern, social web apps such as Facebook and Twitter, to maximise familiarity for new users, but this design language was also woven into the existing format, ensuring a relatively seamless experience for anyone who already understood how reddit worked.\n\n\n\n“*Reddit is a personal experience. How people spend their time on the site and within its communities is very different from one user to the next. The kind of community you’re browsing, your role within it, your physical location, and even the device that you’re browsing from can heavily influence your experience and needs. Whether we’re talking about moderators, new users, “lurkers” or even the uninitiated, a user’s experience on Reddit is completely dependent upon context. That said, context was a really important consideration as we built the guiding principles for the redesign. We wanted to build a site that was approachable, inclusive, personal and human. To do that required building choice and customisation into the product.”*\n\n\n\n*Diego Perez, Reddit’s Head of Design*\n\n\n\n\n\nWith this in mind, there were still some dramatic changes to the overall structure of the site, such as:\n\n\n\n* Merging of fragmented menu systems (horizontal and vertical) into a single, unified navigation - this initially took the form of a hamburger menu, and was later iterated into a cohesive header menu with a dropdown menu for navigation\n* Introduction of “views”, allowing users to customise their experience via three distinct layouts: Card, Classic, and Compact. This was designed to provide a tailored experience for users with different needs:\n\n  * Card view: Inspired by current best practices and familiar design patterns, borrowing cues from popular social networks\n  * Classic view: Inspired by the original reddit layout and design language, to maintain familiarity\n  * Compact view: For users who want to scroll through lots of content quickly, with extra-high density\n* Posts opening within a lightbox window, to keep users in the experience and encourage discussion"},{"content":"# The Rollout\n\nReddit’s rollout process was deliberately slow-paced and gradual, interspersed with regular iterations based on feedback from selected users during alpha and beta stages."},{"images":[{"src":"/img/rollout.png","alt":"Reddit's user testing plan"}],"content":"Reddit also leveraged its enormous userbase via the Redesign community. By creating a dedicated community for the redesign, and posting regular updates, they offered users a sense of transparency regarding the redesign, and an opportunity to feed back on their progress. This also benefited Reddit, as it created an opportunity to gather immediate, qualitative feedback with every update, and to engage in direct discussion with their users at their convenience.\n\n\n\nThe rollout process began in July 2017, with a select few alpha testers, and completed in May 2018. It’s important to note that while the rollout is officially complete, Reddit’s new design has still not reached feature parity with the old Reddit. While this does not affect regular users as much as it affects moderators and admins, certain site features, such as subreddit analytics reporting, are still not available from within the redesign, and to date, Reddit has not offered users any concrete information on when feature parity might be reached.\n\n\n\nReddit also made the decision to retain the entire old design, under the old.reddit.com subdomain, to appease power users, resistant to the new design, and as a fallback for features that were not present in the redesign. Since the underlying architecture and data structures were not changed, it was feasible to do this, though it may be representative of some technical debt."},{"content":"# The Reception\n\n## [](<>)User Reactions\n\nReddit’s redesign has suffered incredible scrutiny from its users, many of whom have threatened to leave the site altogether if Reddit ceases to support the old version of the site (old.reddit.com). Using Reddit’s own algorithms to sort the posts within /r/Redesign to see the all-time, top posts, the top five resulting posts are the following:\n\n1. *[“I made an extension that forces reddit to load the old design”](https://www.reddit.com/r/redesign/comments/8gpy1e/i_made_an_extension_that_forces_reddit_to_load/)*\n2. *[“This is ridiculous. Please, for the love of God, get rid of the redesign.”](https://www.reddit.com/r/redesign/comments/8gqbfi/this_is_ridiculous_please_for_the_love_of_god_get/)*\n3. *[“Despite everyone saying the redesign is perfect, please align these before we all go insane.”](https://www.reddit.com/r/redesign/comments/8d8qws/despite_everyone_saying_the_redesign_is_perfect)* - (Tongue in cheek post from the CEO)\n4. *[“If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.”](https://www.reddit.com/r/redesign/comments/8gz7td/if_it_aint_broke_dont_fix_it/)*\n5. *[“The loss of purple links SUCKS. I extensively rely on them to keep track of news that I’ve read vs not read…”](https://www.reddit.com/r/redesign/comments/8ebzh1/the_loss_of_purple_links_sucks_i_extensively_rely/)*\n\nIt is evident within the above linked posts that many users were unhappy with various aspects of the redesign. However, it can be quite difficult to differentiate between substantial feedback and unsubstantial, subjective outrage, masked as feedback. During the rollout period, regular users would frequently see negative posts about the redesign reaching the front page of reddit. Some common complaints included:\n\n* Inline native ads are deceptive, as they look too similar to legitimate user posts\n* Features missing/moved\n* Too much white space on either side of the content (not applicable to classic or compact views)\n* Lack of transparency from Reddit throughout the redesign rollout\n\nIn addition to this, many community moderators, especially those in charge of discussion based communities, felt that t*[he redesign negatively impacted their communities](https://www.reddit.com/r/redesign/comments/7zndq9/the_redesign_doesnt_value_discussion_subreddits/)*.\n\n“*The pop-up/overlay approach to opening posts feels more like a ‘preview’, as if we aren’t really supposed to spend too long in the comments.”*\n\n*Kal Turnbull, creator of /r/ChangeMyView*\n\nSport communities were among those who were worst affected by the redesign. Due to their very specific use cases, they had relied heavily on their previous ability to style their communities with custom CSS (a feature of the old reddit), and had made extensive use of the old site’s “flair” system, which was simplified in the redesign, to introduce complex methods of flagging different users and posts as a means to categorise content and verify celebrity posters, for example.\n\n## [](<>)Metrics\n\nTo attempt to measure the success of Reddit’s redesign, I have located some basic metrics:"},{"images":[{"src":"/img/similarweb.png","alt":"Reddit's SimilarWeb analytics: Feb 2018 - March 2019"}]},{"images":[{"src":"/img/mods.png","alt":"Moderator analytics from Reddit: Apr 2018 - Apr 2019"}],"content":"The above statistics display overall page views throughout the last year from SimilarWeb, alongside distributed uniques and page views for the /r/BestOf, /r/Atheism and /r/CasualConversation communities, supplied to me by a moderator for those communities. It is worth noting that the community-specific graphs were supplied to me on the 18th of April 2019, and thus the numbers for April are incomplete, and that the redesign went completely public on the 2nd of April 2018, so we can be sure that as of that date, all users would be shown the redesign by default. It is also worth noting that the official Reddit app is consistent with the redesign in terms of look and feel, and so users of “Reddit Apps”, as referenced in the community-specific metrics, are at least also users of something that shares the same overall design language as the Reddit website redesign.\n\n\n\nNone of the above metrics display an overall negative impact on page views or unique visitors, during the last year. In fact, most of them would suggest overall growth, and therefore indicate that the redesign has been successful in terms of retaining users, and possibly in attracting new users. The community-specific metrics suggest an extremely steep increase in users as of October 2018, though I haven’t been able to identify the cause of this, and I have been supplied some similar metrics for smaller communities, that are not consistent with this, suggesting that these fluctuations are at least partly related to the context of the communities themselves, and not indicative of the site as a whole:"},{"images":[{"src":"/img/small-mods.png","alt":"Reddit moderator analytics"}]},{"content":"# Outcome\n\nThe judicious and vigilant approach through which Reddit undertook its redesign has proved effective, despite the user backlash. One only has to look at the “*[Digg Exodus](https://www.themarysue.com/digg-v4-rebellion/)*” to understand the implications of a truly bad redesign: Digg not only failed to listen to its users; it failed to ask them in the first place, and redesigned the entire platform without adequate research or consideration for its users, resulting in a mass migration of users from Digg to Reddit. I have no doubt that Reddit benefitted from Digg v4 not only by welcoming its ex-users, but also by way of a lesson in how not to redesign a website, especially one with a tightly integrated and opinionated userbase.\n\nBy understanding the workings of Reddit’s redesign process, and looking at the outcomes, there are a number of lessons to be learned from both their successes and their failures:\n\n## [](<>)Lesson 1: You Can’t Please Everyone\n\nThe user backlash to Reddit’s redesign was somewhat predictable, and it is clear that Reddit did everything they could to mitigate its severity, from the carefully constructed rollout procedure, to the community engagement through /r/Redesign, and the admin activity in relevant discussions. Despite this, there was still an extremely large, vocal segment of users who deeply opposed the redesign. What's worse is that these were among the most dedicated users of the site.\n\n## [](<>)Lesson 2: Honesty is the Best Policy\n\nReddit has been criticised for a lack of transparency during the redesign process, which I believe is more in reference to their motivations for the redesign than the actual process by which it was undertaken, as the latter was very well documented. Reddit has been scaling up its position as an ad publisher, largely facilitated by the redesign and the introduction of native ad formats, and has neglected to address this fact publicly, in the context of the redesign. This has spawned an element of mistrust amongst users. Total transparency regarding business decisions, as well as the inner workings of a complex process such as a large scale redesign, is unfeasible if not impossible, but transparency regarding top-line motivations would have done a lot to build trust with users.\n\nWe should ask why Reddit has been so shrewd in regards to this point. The fact that the platform survives in part thanks to volunteer moderators definitely raises questions about monetisation and fair compensation for moderators. Further, I think there is a disconnect between how Reddit is seen by its users, and how it is seen by management. \n\n## [](<>)Lesson 3: Know Your Users, Even the \"Edge Cases\"\n\nHad Reddit taken some more time to understand the niche use cases of its userbase, certain decisions made during the redesign process would have likely taken different forms. For example, the decision to strip back the flair functionality, used so extensively by sport communities that it had become a core feature for them, would have not been made in light of the fact that it would be insufficient. The same goes for limiting customisation options for moderators, which have since had to be expanded. \n\nThe reality is that what may have seemed like an \"edge case\" when looking at the entire platform, in fact is a consistent use case spanning an entire segment of communities.\n\nA little extra vigilance during the research phase, focusing on existing edge cases and understanding user motivations, would have made for a smoother launch. \n\nGiven the aforementioned disconnect between Reddit and its users, I have to wonder whether Reddit's management is a little out of touch. If they were more willing to find a middle-ground between their financial ambitions and the needs of their loyal user base, who actually moderate their platform for free, they may have fared better. \n\n## [](<>)Lesson 4: Sharing is Caring\n\nThe Redesign community (AKA /r/Redesign) allowed the Reddit team to engage directly with users, for immediate, qualitative feedback on releases and concepts. \n\nThis is very much a double edged sword - it was bold of Reddit to allow users to post in the Redesign community, and to enable full discussion features there, as this opened up the community as a platform for the bad as well as the good. It strikes me that the benefit of this far outweighed the cost, only because the Reddit team were actually prepared to invest in this as a resource, by reading, understanding, and responding to the opinions of the users within the community. Unfortunately, this did little to address many users' more fundamental issues with Reddit's practices as a business.\n\n## [](<>)Lesson 5: A Missing Feature is a Bug\n\nA large proportion of negative user feedback stemmed from the fact that certain features were missing from the redesign at launch. I believe this was a mistake on Reddit’s part - by rolling out an incomplete redesign, they knowingly served users a watered-down experience. This decision is one that fundamentally broke the user experience, causing users with learned behaviours and expectations of functionality to feel short-changed.

After 6 months invested, I was in love with my new creative process, but completely unable to finish a track. After years producing drum & bass music for label releases, and spending months on complex mixes with long FX chains, buses, and convoluted compression set ups, I found I was stuck with only what I could achieve inside the Octatrack. No mixdown, no sidechains, no buses, no polished, finished track at the end of the process. Nothing I would be happy to release.\n\n**I listed my Octatrack for sale on Elektronauts.**\n\n\nI received a reply from a user called jbone1313. He had developed an Ableton template based around a series of MIDI clips and automations that he told me could solve this problem, yielding full stems for all the tracks in my project, including crossfader movements and scene changes. He even provided me with a prototype project file.\n\n\nHaving fully dissected the project, recreated it a few times, tested thoroughly, I decided to document how it works so that it can be of use to others.\n\n\nThis project works with a relatively straightforward concept. You perform a song once, while Ableton records all the midi data for your crossfader movements and scene changes to a MIDI clip. Then, you enter a couple of values in a couple of places, hit play and walk away. When you come back, you’ll have an audio file containing individual stems for all the tracks from your Octatrack. \n\n\n### Some Caveats:\n\n\n* This method only records your crossfader movements and scene changes. If you want your performance to include things like encoder movements or live-played trigs, you’ll have to do some extra work. I won’t cover that stuff here, but I can give you an idea of how to do it (individual midi tracks for each OT track, multiple armed channels etc).\n\n* Manual mutes do not work. We need to use the ‘solo’ functionality to bounce each track out individually, and this overrides track mutes. However, arrangement mutes do work, so if you want to use mutes as part of your performance, you’ll need to use them within the arranger, and not on-the-fly. You can also just edit the audio clips at the end if you prefer.\n\n* Ableton does not record MIDI program changes. This means pattern changes don’t work either. You’ll need to use arranger mode for this too.\n\n\n### Ableton Setup\n\n\nSetup 9 scenes, named T1-T8 and STOP.\n\n\nSetup 9 MIDI channels, named T1-T8 and MIDI MASTER."},{"images":[{"src":"/img/image19_6504fb8545.png","alt":"It's Not Overbridge for the Octatrack, but It's Close Enough"}]},{"content":"On each MIDI channels, add an External Instrument device, and map each to the correct midi channel for its respective track.

What we now call 'AI' is fundamentally no different to the machine learning algorithms that enabled Cambridge Analytica to effectively brainwash electorates around the world.\n\nIn the meantime, everyone has seemingly forgotten about the Snowden leaks, and about Cambridge Analytica, and we've accepted programmatic advertising as an inert facet of our daily lives. Even now, if you Google 'Programmatic Advertising', you'll find swathes of innocent, enthusiastic articles about how great it is for business. [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/betsyatkins/2021/06/17/programmatic-marketing/) describes it as \"one of the most important tools in your company’s arsenal\", without a hint of irony in the comparison to weaponry, and gushes at how ads can be served by using \"hyper-specific data including the target consumers age, location, career, and specific consumer interests\". \n\nNotice how very few of these articles will mention where the data actually *comes from*. The reason why? They don't know. \n\nWe joke about how creepy it is when our phones start advertising products to us that we discussed with a friend a couple of hours earlier. Are we so naïve as to write that off as a coincidence, or have we simply accepted our fate? In reality, smart devices all over our homes, in our cars, in our offices, and in our pockets, are constantly feeding minute, granular data points to each other via [data brokers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_broker); companies that build their business on buying, selling, and aggregating data about every single one of us. They build rich profiles on who we are by absorbing and concentrating data from sources that we tend to think of as isolated from one another. Your [Smart TV analyses your conversations](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jan/29/what-your-smart-tv-knows-about-you-and-how-to-stop-it-harvesting-data), while [your phone uses Google Maps to track your location](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/google-maps-alternatives-privacy), and while [Facebook reads your messages](https://crambler.com/truth-about-facebook-messenger-app-privacy/), and so on, and so on. These disparate data sources do not remain independent. Somewhere, likely in multiple places, these data is being correlated and aggregated to build an obsessive profile on you, like a creepy, infatuated stalker, potentially with a political agenda.\n\nThe crux of the issue was exposed so brazenly by Cambridge Analytica five years ago: Privacy is not about hiding secrets; it is about protecting ourselves from bad actors who wield the most advanced [PsyOp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_warfare) tools the world has ever known, and who can influence decisions that we believe to be our own.\n\n# How to protect yourself\n\nShort of donning a tin-foil hat and going to live in the woods, it's practically impossible to completely isolate yourself from all vulnerability to data snoopers. However, there are some practical steps that anyone can take to improve things. \n\nThis is not all-or-nothing. By even taking a single step to prevent exposure of your personal data, you're already doing 100% more than most people. Furthermore, it's actually not that hard. A little awareness, and a little selectivity about which 'Agree' buttons you click goes a very long way. \n\nTo that end, I've spent the last few years distancing myself from platforms such as Google and Facebook. Google is especially nefarious in that they collect so much data from so many different points of our daily lives. They do this not only through our use of Google services, but through advertising, as the largest ad platform in the world. They have recently been [ordered by the EU](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jun/14/eu-regulator-google-sell-ad-tech-business-competition-commission) to break up their ad business because they are seen as a monopoly.\n\nHere's a list of recommendations for alternative services that I have personally used, and can vouch for:\n\n## Search\n\n[DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) and [Qwant](https://duckduckgo.com/), and [Brave](https://search.brave.com/) are all great alternatives to Google. You won't be totally free of ads, but the ads you do get will be dumber and less spooky.\n\n## Email\n\nGmail is almost everyone's go-to these days, but there are some great alternatives that are much more privacy conscious. [Proton Mail](https://proton.me/mail) is a popular choice due to their end-to-end encryption. I use [Mailbox.org](https://mailbox.org/) which is rock solid, and has been running since the mid-nineties!\n\n## Web Browsing\n\n### Alternative browsers\n\nThis is yet another area where Google is insistently pervasive. If you're looking for a better browsing experience with better privacy, either [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox) or [Brave](https://brave.com/download/) will serve you well. \n\nAt the very least, [uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/) will kill most trackers and give you an ad-free web.\n\n### VPNs\n\nI won't go into VPNs too much, because there's a lot to say, and this is probably a step too far for most people. In a nutshell, VPNs bounce your web traffic through an intermediary which can mask your location not only from websites and apps, but even from your Internet Service Provider. \n\nFor the best data privacy, it's recommended to use a VPN that does not log your connections, so that even the VPN provider doesn't know who you are. \n\nThe downside to using a VPN is a lack of convenience, and sometimes limited bandwidth, or increased latency.\n\n### Sandboxing\n\nSandboxing is a great way to prevent cookies from tracking you around the web. Firefox now comes with [containers](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-use-firefox-containers) built-in, meaning that individual sites, or groups of sites, are ignorant about your other online activities. This helps to break the crumbtrail of data that follows you around the web.\n\n## Cloud storage\n\nThere are tons of cloud storage providers out there, with varying degrees of privacy. Google Drive's privacy is [basically non-existent](https://freedom.press/training/blog/newsrooms-lets-talk-about-gsuite/) and its safe to assume that they are reading your documents. For a more secure alternative, I recommend [pCloud](https://www.pcloud.com/eu) or [Sync](https://www.sync.com/). Both of these services have apps which let you automatically upload your photos and videos from your phone too, so you can effectively ditch Google Photos for backing them up.\n\nI ended up with a self-hosted [NextCloud](https://nextcloud.com/) installation, which is not for the faint-hearted, but it works out pretty cheap when you want to store multiple terabytes of data. If you're going down the self-hosted route, [PhotoPrism](https://www.photoprism.app/) is a fantastic Google Photos alternative.\n\n## Maps\n\nThere are plenty of alternatives to Google maps, with varying degrees of usefulness. [Here](https://wego.here.com) and [Citymapper](https://citymapper.com/) are decent options. However I do still find myself using Google Maps often, but I do so using [Hermit](https://hermit.chimbori.com/) as a sandbox, and without using a Google account.\n\n## Your Phone\n\nYeah, Google owns that too, unless you're an iPhone user. In fact, if you're an iPhone user, you're already doing pretty well in this regard, as they allow you to easily block apps from tracking you. If you're on Android, [CalyxOS](https://calyxos.org/) is a totally de-googled alternative that you can install on a range of off-the-shelf handsets with an automatic installer!"}],"tags":["Technology","Privacy"],"toc":[],"body":{"type":"root","children":[]},"text":"","dir":"/articles/posts","path":"/articles/posts/2023-06-29-practical-tips-for-protecting-your-data-ditching-google-and-why-it-matters","extension":".md","createdAt":"2023-06-29T15:25:31.191Z","updatedAt":"2023-06-29T15:25:31.191Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1688052473109},"$loki":17},{"slug":"coravin","description":"Coravin is a US based start up, offering an innovative product which enables people to pour wine from the bottle without removing the cork, using a specialised needle to pierce the cork and replace the lost volume of wine with compressed argon gas.","title":"Coravin","hero":"/img/new-project.jpg","thumb":"/img/new-project-1-.jpg","category":"Design & Development","year":2015,"meta_description":"Coravin is a US based start up, offering an innovative product which enables people to pour wine from the bottle without removing the cork, using a specialised needle to pierce the cork and replace the lost volume of wine with compressed argon gas.","summary":"Coravin is a US based start up, offering an innovative product which enables people to pour wine from the bottle without removing the cork, using a specialised needle to pierce the cork and replace the lost volume of wine with compressed argon gas.\n\nAfter designing a number of campaign materials for Coravin, they enlisted BPL Marketing to design and build a number of international brochure websites to showcase their products in markets in which they don’t operate an eCommerce business. \n\nCoravin was in relatively early stages of brand development, so we had limited informaiton in the way of brand guidelines.

As part of our sponsorship of the event, I led the production of brand materials, both physical and digital, to showcase NewsNow's product and values to event-goers. \n\nThis project included designing print advertisements for the event brochures and helping to develop and install Raspberry-Pi-powered video kiosks throughout the venue which displayed a rolling feed of live headlines, interspersed with a promotional video. I also wrote, produced, and edited the video, which was shown on the main stage before each talk.","background":"The Folkestone Book Festival hosted readings and interviews with local authors. The theme of the festival was “The Shape of Things to Come”. Amid Brexit, climate change protests, and other divisive and prominent political and cultural shifts of the time (even pre-pandemic!), this theme aligned well with NewsNow’s long-standing mission to encourage people to read widely and develop informed understandings of important issues. \n\nNewsNow’s partnership with the festival was implemented via an array of digital kiosks placed around the festival venue, displaying a bespoke Vue.js web app that showed the latest news headlines and imagery on a variety of topics, directly from our API, running on Raspberry Pis. \n\nIn addition to this, we were offered the opportunity to display a short promotional film, both in the main auditorium before each event, and intermittently on our kiosks.","goals":"The overall goals for the event, aside from the overarching social purpose to support the local creative industry in Folkestone, were to develop and elevate NewsNow's brand identity and stimulate public awareness of NewsNow as a brand, and its values of media plurality and supporting public-interest journalism. This was set to be achieved though production and deployment of high quality brand materials.","goalsImages":[{"src":"/img/2020_12_03_21_30_59_2_8ec75781aa.jpg","caption":"Print advertisement design for NewsNow as Principle Partner of the 2019 Creative Folkestone Book Festival"}],"method":"My role throughout the event was distributed as follows:\n\n* Design, development, and overall implementation of the kiosk app, working closely with the company directors and the development team, and as the sole designer\n* Aiding in technical and practical aspects of the A/V installation, from display panel technology specifications to prototype setups, to testing various mini-PC devices to run the kiosks, to the physical installation of our Raspberry Pi units on location\n* Working alongside the COO, with various merchandise suppliers to manage our promotional merchandise for the event, supplying print-ready design files and quality control\n* Writing, storyboarding, editing, and audio engineering and composition for the short film, in a collaborative process with the directors and editorial team\n* Design for a full-page print ad to run in the festival programme\n\nThis was a great project for me as it gave me a rare opportunity to use my diverse skill-set in a professional capacity. That said, it was not without challenges to overcome.\n\nThe biggest challenge was the short film. Through our early concept meetings where various team members developed draft scripts, I presented a concept that leant heavily into the divisive political climate of the time. Given that NewsNow's brand identity is based in rationality, impartialism, and advocating media plurality, it can be difficult to position the brand in a way that really makes a strong statement. My solution to this was to harness inflammatory political issues, illustrate their extreme polarisation, and present NewsNow as an antidote to these binary extremes. This included coining the slogan \"There's more than one way to see things\".\n\nThe team decided to run with my script by a unanimous vote. The concept behind the piece is that of unity in the face of adversity. In a time when people seem most divided, and when polarisation appears to trump rational discourse, it’s important for us to recognise each other as human beings; to be understanding, and to take the time to appreciate nuance, complexity, and even chaos. By taking the time to see the world through the eyes of others, we can learn to appreciate those who see things differently, rather than reject them. This concept is not only something that I am personally passionate about, but it is representative of NewsNow’s fundamental purpose.\n\nInitially, we had planned to outsource the production to a video agency, but when deliberating over early storyboards and mockups, we collectively decided we weren't satisfied with the direction they were taking, and after some deliberation over our in-house capabilities, I put myself forward to produce the film. \n\nI had to produce the film within an extremely tight timeframe in the lead-up to the festival, whilst also balancing my work on the Vue.js kiosk design and build, print merchandise designs, and AV setup. Given these constraints, shooting our own footage was not an option, so we had to rely on editorial and stock footage. This meant hours upon hours of scouring Getty, iStock, and Shutterstock, to find footage that would complement the script without looking too obviously like stock footage. In addition, the film would run most of the time on our on-site kiosks, which would not have audio. This meant that while the script was written with the intent for it to be narrated, we instead had to trim it down and use synced captions.\n\nWith no narrator, the music became a crucial factor for the occasions when the film would be projected on stage with audio, and sourcing royalty free music that could effectively fit the progression of the script was near impossible. With 15+ years of music production under my belt, I ended up taking this on too! I took a rhythmic piece of stock music, added a chord progression and some additional percussion, bass, and effects, and evolved the piece to reflect the tone of our narrative.\n\nBeyond the film, the print advertisement I designed for the festival brochure was a highlight for me. I enjoyed the refreshing opportunity to work for print, which is something I've not had much opportunity to do in the past. Using the strapline from the video; \"There's more than one way to see things\", I designed a kind of visual puzzle. The core of the design is a 3D isometric shape, which would appear as a different 2D shape when viewed head-on from any one axis. This is a very literal, yet subtle, visualization of the core message, and I designed it in such a way that it would work harmoniously with the branding of the festival.","methodImages":[],"results":"In the end, I turned around the entire film, sourcing footage, editing, writing, syncing captions, and producing the music, all within a couple of weeks. I also did this whilst balancing my other responsibilities in web development, design, and consulting on the audio-visual setup. \n\nThe film was well-received at the festival, both by the organisers and the attendees. Classes of children, attending the festival on school trips, applauded in the auditorium at the end of the film, and it has since been a linchpin in subsequent discussions about NewsNow’s ethos and brand identity.\n\nHaving said that, I definitely felt the time-pinch, and I would have loved to have done things slightly differently. While I came up with the initial concept, I did also work closely with senior management during production to accommodate their feedback and contribuitions in my work, and while this would have been great with more time, the time constraints made it difficult to reconcile some ideas effectively. I also would have liked to spent more time on post production, colour correction, frame interpolation, and narration, which would have yielded a much more polished end product. \n\nOverall, the event was a great success. As a team, we had successfully created a set of reusable assets, skills, and processes with which to approach future events, and had developed a stronger brand identity both internally and in the eyes of event attendees.","resultsImages":[],"youtube":"<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/aaZ6qrmYpMg\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","wrap-up":"","toc":[],"body":{"type":"root","children":[]},"text":"","dir":"/work/case-studies","path":"/work/case-studies/newsnow-the-creative-folkestone-book-festival","extension":".md","createdAt":"2023-06-29T15:25:31.191Z","updatedAt":"2023-06-29T15:25:31.191Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1688052473111},"$loki":19},{"slug":"newsnow-user-research-initiative","description":"A long-running user research initiative, consisting of design, prototyping, conducting surveys, analysis, and user interviews","title":"NewsNow: User Research Initiative","hero":"/img/hero-nnux.jpg","thumb":"/img/thumb-nnux.jpg","category":"UX Research","year":2020,"meta_description":"A long-running user research initiative, consisting of design, prototyping, conducting surveys, analysis, and user interviews","summary":"During my role at NewsNow, I initiated and led a long-running user research initiative. Design methodology at NewsNow had traditionally been informed by engineering, along with A/B testing paradigms and voluntary user feedback.\n\nThis project was a huge undertaking, consisting of design, prototyping, conducting surveys, analysis, and user interviews, and collating all of our learnings into both actionable tasks, and updated internal processes around the product lifecycle.\n\nNot only was this an incredibly eye-opening project, from speaking directly with users such as high-flying corporate professionals from the States, and 3G-wielding teenagers on the streets of Nigeria, to stretching the limits of what hi-fi prototyping is capable of, but it resulted in some fantastic learnings for the entire business.","background":"Existing understanding of the makeup of NewsNow’s userbase and their motivations had been inferred from A/B test results for features over a span of many years, and while this served as a valuable starting point, it was far from concrete. \n\nThere was, however, a large appetite within the team, including senior management, editorial, and development team members, to better understand our users. Given this appetite, and a product roadmap brimming with large-scale design and development projects, it seemed right to make strides towards uncovering our userbase and giving our users a seat at the table. I put together a plan of action and advocated for human-centred design principles as part of a more efficient and effective product design and development process.","goals":"The purpose of this initiative was to introduce complementary, strength-based research and testing processes to lay the foundation of human-centred design principles and to facilitate a more effective product lifecycle in the future.\n\nMoreover, with a full product redesign in the works, we had a direct need to fulfil in terms of testing that design with real people, who were representative of our core userbase demographics. The problem was that we had very limited data on who our core userbase actually was, since no previous research had been done in the company's twenty-five-year history. \n\nThis resulted in a clear set of goals:\n\n1. Identify core readership demographics\n2. Test our new design with real people to ensure it was rock-solid before release\n3. Implement processes to facilitate further research","method":"The initiative was implemented via my own twist on Design Thinking methodology. The reason for not following the *Empathise, Define, Ideate, Prototype, Test* process to the letter was that the product was not yet in a state where it would have been conducive to iterative product design processes. We were mid-redesign, developing a new design system to pave the way for a more iterative workflow, but we needed to ensure that the new design was going to be well received by our users and that any major potential pain points could be worked out prior to release. \n\nMy resulting methodology went as follows: \n\n## Data-gathering\n\nThis initial phase was primarily a data-gathering effort. I launched a site-wide demographic survey to a randomly selected subset of users, asking broad questions about people’s interests, usage habits, age, gender, location, and general news reading habits, with the goal of identifying both the general demographic makeup of our existing userbase, as well as NewsNow's place within their news diet. The survey was implemented in Hotjar, and thus I was able to gather additional metadata for each submission, such as from which pages users submitted the survey and information about their device. In addition, Hotjar enabled me to collect responses from users who did not complete the full survey, which proved especially useful in looking for selection/response bias.\n\nIn addition to the survey, I also used Hotjar to generate a wide array of heatmaps, to look more specifically at how users on different topic categories might behave differently from one another.\n\nFinally, I was able to gather quantitative data from Google Analytics to further understand device/browser/OS distribution, usage habits, and behaviour.\n\n## Analysis\n\nThe demographic survey generated approximately 6000 responses, which I exported as a CSV and processed in Google Sheets. I spent a long time sifting through all the responses, slicing the data in various ways, and looking for patterns that might help me to uncover segments within the userbase. As part of this process, I weighted the responses by geography, and device category, using the Google Analytics data from the period of time in which the survey was active as a source of truth from which to calculate weights that could be applied in combination to individual responses.\n\nUpon applying weights to the data and segmenting by country, I discovered a number of very clear segments within our userbase. Focusing on what were by far the three largest segments; UK, US, and Nigeria, I was able to identify vastly different distributions of age, topical interests, and device usage between the three groups. What was particularly interesting about this was that the demographics in each segment appeared somewhat narrow; we were appealing to specific age ranges and categories of interest in each country that were distinct from one another, and that appeared unlikely to be representative of online news readership demographics as a whole. To validate this, I referenced publicly available data regarding online news readership from [Ofcom](https://www.ofcom.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0024/116529/news-consumption-2018.pdf), [Pew Research](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/09/11/key-findings-about-the-online-news-landscape-in-america/), [Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/381569/leading-news-and-media-sites-usa-by-share-of-visits/), and [SimilarWeb](https://www.similarweb.com/top-websites/united-states/category/sports). \n\nBy checking our own data against these broader demographic insights, I was not only able to confirm the boundaries of our users’ segmentation but was also able to identify prominent demographics in the wider population, both in the UK and the US, that were underrepresented in the NewsNow userbase. \n\nBased on my analysis of the survey results, analytics data, and third-party data, I was able to craft a handful of personas, representative of our core users. In addition, based on the demographics I had found to be under-represented, I created additional personas, representative of our additional target demographics, with the goal in mind of better serving these demographics and subsequently growing and diversifying the NewsNow userbase. I created a full write-up of my findings, including my methodology, data and charts, sources, and a summary of the results, which I presented to the wider team. \n\n## User Interviews\n\nThe next step was to engage with real people, in person, and begin to build a rapport with the people behind our personas. Through our earlier demographic survey, and through dedicated research participant recruitment services such as UserInterviews.com, we were able to work with users that were representative of all our user personas, from a range of backgrounds; from the UK, US, and Nigeria.\n\nThe methodology for the interviews was based on a semi-structured interview format, which offered a relaxed atmosphere and an opportunity to build a rapport with participants, whilst still ensuring that all our talking points were covered. For the purposes of this round of interviews we had considered creating hi-fi Figma prototypes from our existing designs. However, NewsNow being an engineering-led business meant that we could do one better; we had a working staging site with real data, where our new design system had been implemented in Vue.js, and while it was far away from full feature-parity, it was leagues ahead of a Figma prototype.\n\nInterviews were conducted on Lookback.io, recording video, audio, and notes, and lasting approximately 30 minutes, for which users were incentivised with Amazon vouchers. I lead all the interviews, with a midweight UI designer observing and keeping notes. The process for each interview was to first understand a bit more about the participant; their interests, hobbies, news-reading habits, and a bit about their day-to-day life, to understand how our product might fit into their day. I would then show them the product, and ask for their first impressions and gut-feelings about the overall look, feel, and utility. Beyond that, participants were free to use and explore the product and were asked to try and vocalise their thoughts and actions as much as possible while they did so. I would answer questions, make notes of potential pain points, and occasionally offer some steer, either to ensure participants were able to cover all the talking points, or to help on the occasion that they got stuck with the prototype or the UX. At the end of each interview, I would sit down with our UI designer for a general recap, to discuss any points of interest, collate notes, and tag certain points of note in the recording. \n\nOnce all the interviews were complete, I worked with the design team to create a summary of our findings, as well as a highlights reel, containing the most interesting and useful clips of our interview recordings, grouped into categories, to offer colleagues and management a quick glimpse into the responses of our participants.","results":"The overall results of this initiative were enlightening, challenging, and extremely positive. For the first time, we were able to understand and empathise with the NewsNow userbase in a direct and immediate way. We were shown which parts of our new product were working well and in some cases even better than expected, as well as parts of the product that needed improvement. We were given a better understanding of how our product fit into the wider industry, how our users interpreted the brand against competitors, and how we might better serve a more diverse range of people in the future. \n\nWe also found that some of our initial expectations were challenged: There were certain areas of the new product which we had been intending to make personalisable, or using algorithms to modulate aspects of the UI based on the user segment being served, but in fact we found that our users harmonised on certain aspects of the design.  In the end, it seemed that by optimising the core areas of the product in-line with the needs of our users, we would negate the need for additional complexity. We were also able to re-prioritise our product roadmap and add more specificity to design tasks in the backlog based on these new insights.","toc":[],"body":{"type":"root","children":[]},"text":"","dir":"/work/case-studies","path":"/work/case-studies/newsnow-user-research-initiative","extension":".md","createdAt":"2023-06-29T15:25:31.191Z","updatedAt":"2023-06-29T15:25:31.191Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1688052473111},"$loki":20},{"slug":"newsnows-new-format","description":"Building and scaling a design system, with implementation in Vue.js, for NewsNow","title":"NewsNow's New Format","hero":"/img/nnnf.png","thumb":"/img/newsnowlogo.jpg","category":"Design & Development","year":2020,"meta_description":"Building and scaling a design system, with implementation in Vue.js, for NewsNow","summary":"My first project upon starting at NewsNow was the largest redesign the product had seen in more than 15 years.

I learned tons, and took great satisfaction in a quality piece of work that I devoted over two years to delivering, and that was by all measures a success.","summaryImages":[{"src":"/img/1-z_7uafpbcxd-6i5g7tl49q.webp","caption":"The original NewsNow website from 1995"},{"src":"/img/www-screenshots.staging.newsnow.co-1.png","caption":"NewsNow's website as it was when I began work"},{"src":"/img/reskin.png","caption":"My initial, straight-to-code reskin of the NewsNow website"},{"src":"/img/screenshot-2023-06-23-at-22-01-38-newsnow-the-independent-news-discovery-platform.png","caption":"The New Format, top stories, on desktop"},{"src":"/img/screenshot-2023-06-23-at-22-02-28-world-news-latest-world-news-newsnow.png","caption":"The New Format, latest news, on desktop"},{"src":"/img/screenshot-2023-06-23-at-22-02-54-world-news-latest-world-news-newsnow.jpg","caption":"The New Format, top stories, on mobile"},{"src":"/img/screenshot-2023-06-23-at-22-03-07-world-news-latest-world-news-newsnow.jpg","caption":"The New Format, latest news, on mobile"}],"background":"Over its 20+ year history, NewsNow has been under constant, iterative development. As with any long-term project, especially one that had started life in 1997, sooner or later a refactor becomes necessary. In this case, refactoring the design was equally as important as refactoring the codebase. Additionally, there were plans to develop large improvements to the product’s functionality, which would necessarily disrupt aspects of both the codebase and the design. The existing design was simply not flexible enough to accommodate these new developments, meaning that the product was in need of a fresh coat of paint, and maybe a slight rethink of the walls and foundations underneath, on which these new features could be built.\n\nBeyond this, there was scope for a larger redesign, using the initial reskin as a foundational starting-point. The New Format, as we called it, would be a large undertaking, with many stages of iteration and research.","goals":"The new design would need to give the product a much needed aesthetic lift, bringing the look and feel in line with contemporary standards. The design would also need to adhere to accessibility standards to ensure good usability, and while we set no rigid rule on WCAG accessibility standards, we aimed for AA accessibility where possible. The design would also need to be modular, flexible, and scalable, to accommodate new and complex features later on. \n\nFinally, due to the diverse nature of the userbase, specifically those in English-speaking countries in the developing world, the product would need to retain its high level of browser compatibility, offering an improved experience to people browsing on feature phones, using Opera Mini with extreme data saving enabled.\n\nOf course throughout this process it was vitally important to ensure that our updates were beneficial to NewsNow's extremely large, loyal, and long-standing user base.","goalsImages":[{"src":"/img/NNnewFormat.jpg","caption":"NewsNow's New Format"}],"method":"### Reskin\n\nBeyond the overall implementation and refactor of the codebase, we also tested rigorously to ensure a high level of browser compatibility. The site is fully compatible with Opera Mini on feature phones, bar certain customisation features, and user accounts. Additionally, I devised a new alternative to the existing device-detection system which relied heavily on javascript and resulted in a complex matrix of site versions that required individual support. This system used a combination of media queries and support queries in CSS to accurately identify the devices needing special support, and unified site versions for other devices which previously had to be catered for individually, resulting in a much more easily maintainable system.\n\n![NewsNow's brand palette](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:2000/format:webp/1*GA0hYK7JtIrDuk1F1IaUkQ.png)\n\n### Research\n\nEmbarking on a project of this scale, especially as a new member of the team, was no small feat. I took time to analyse the existing product in detail, speaking with members from all areas of the business, including development, editorial, and senior management, to get a full and comprehensive understanding of the business, the product, and the underlying technology.\n\nI felt it important to look at the product in the wider context of the industry, to see how we might want to position ourselves relative to other news aggregators, publishers, and social platforms. NewsNow is unique in this sense; it is a news aggregator that performs similar functions to those by the likes of Google, Apple, and Yahoo, but the number of individual topics and the number of headlines on a given page is more akin to the likes of social media platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter or Reddit. \n\nReddit, specifically, shares many parallels with NewsNow. Firstly, the Information Architecture is inherently similar: Long feeds of headlines, for a near-endless variety of topics, algorithmically sorted and able to be reordered by chronology, popularity, or relevance. In addition, Reddit had also recently embarked on a large redesign project, moving away from a dense, text-based layout that had accumulated a dedicated and loyal userbase, just like that of NewsNow. On the basis of these parallels, I embarked on a [competitor analysis project](/articles/posts/2019-11-21-analysis-reddits-2018-redesign) of sorts, to understand the ‘what’, ‘why’ and ‘how’ of Reddit’s redesign, charting their roadmap, digging up metrics, some of which were kindly supplied to me by subreddit moderators, and drawing actionable conclusions which we were able to implement in our own redesign process. \n\nOnce the initial reskin was complete, I embarked on a proper [user research initative](https://emilsmith.pro/work/case-studies/newsnow-user-research-initiative) to inform our larger redesign as part of the New Format. This helped to guide our product development process throughout the remainder of my time at NewsNow, and changed our position on crucial decisions, such as how to introduce imagery, whcih aspects of the existing layout were most important to our users, and what kinds of navigational tools were fundamental to the experience. In most cases, our assumptions were challenged, or outright disproved!\n\n### Roadmap\n\nEquipped with the learnings from my research phase, I was able to work collaboratively with senior management to specify the scope and deliverables for the New Format, and within the development team to create a scope and task backlog for the technical requirements. We used Asana to manage the project, in which I constructed a set of timelines with clear dependencies between design and development, accounting for testing and refactoring, with a set launch date for our private, opt-in beta. We also took learnings from the Reddit case study to help inform our process, including the implementation of a system to manage user feedback, a public blog post to inform users of upcoming changes, and a staggered rollout to ensure feature-parity prior to the site-wide launch.\n\nThe nature of this project did not necessarily lend itself to a strict goal-setting framework, as it was not intended to drive any specific metric, though we did employ rigorous in-app feedback tools so that we could check user satisfaction metrics throughout the rollout. The success of the project would be measured in our resulting ability to scale and develop the product in the future, and the satisfaction of our dedicated core user base.\n\n### Design\n\nThe design strategy for this project employed the use of atomic design principles to create a modular, component-based design system in Figma, with standardised tokens for measurements, colours, and typography, and context-agnostic, BEM-style components for all UI elements, templates, and pages. The design would be carefully tested against WCAG accessibility guidelines to ensure that colour contrast ratios, font sizes, and interactive elements were sufficiently distinguished and usable.\n\nI opted to work extremely closely with developers on the structure of the design system, since I would also be responsible for building a large proportion of the front end. We discussed stacks, tooling, and coding practices, and used those decisions to inform the kind of functionality we could include in the design. This cohesion between design and development is something I strive for in my work, and the result of this holistic approach is always hugely beneficial.\n\nThe most significant visual update to the site was the introduction of imagery. NewsNow had never hosted images before in all its decades of life, and this was a huge update to the overall user experience, especially considering the perspective of users who had been devotedly scouring through lists of plain text headlines for years. Interestingly, the results of our user research suggested that most users would be very satisfied with an image-heavy, grid-based layout. However, there was a clear segment who absolutely preferred the old list style. This led us to introduce a layout mode toggle, enabling users to customise the experience for themselves.\n\nFundamentally, the design would need to reflect NewsNow as a brand, which was a challenge in itself, since the business had not previously devoted much time to developing a formal brand identity. On this basis, I engaged with senior management over several brainstorming sessions to develop a preliminary brand guidelines document, which included the specification of brand values, identity, and ethos, as well as some visual elements such as typographic rules, a new colour palette, and logo guidelines. Of course, the visual aspects of this document were intended to be under constant evolution throughout the design process, the definition of the core brand values and identity was instrumental in subsequent design decisions.\n\n### Development\n\nImplementation of the new design was a months-long process for the development team at NewsNow. I was responsible for the majority of the front-end build, working closely with a full-stack software developer on migrating from NewsNow’s bespoke, in-house, Perl-based templating system to our new stack, consisting of Perl on the back end, with server-side rendered Vue.js, complete with state management, on the front end. This was a fantastic system to work with; SSR allowed us to preserve our SEO juice, and VueX enabled us to create a seamless experience, client-side. \n\nComponents were developed to mirror the structure of the design system, using BEM syntax and isolated component templates. We took time and care to evaluate and audit the existing code, selecting chunks for preservation, removal, or refactoring. Through this process we also identified features that had gone unused for months or years and were able to simplify the site functionality by pruning such features from the product. \n\n### User Engagement\n\nIn addition to the user research project bringing human-centred design into the operational process at NewsNow, we also made sure to engage users regularly throughout the rollout process.\n\nUpon completion of our initial reskin beta, I wrote up a [Medium piece, outlining our redesign](https://medium.com/newsnow/welcome-to-the-newsnow-redesign-925ccdf008f8) for our users. People who were offered the chance to take part in the beta were directed to this piece to read about the changes being made, the reasoning behind those changes, and the positive impacts those changes were designed to make. In addition, those who took part in the beta were prompted for NPS-style ratings of the new design and offered the opportunity to give in-app feedback, for which we guaranteed a response from the team. Through this feedback mechanic, we were able to assemble a research panel of loyal NewsNow users who agreed to take part in the upcoming research project ahead of the New Format.\n\nThroughout this process, we were able to gather valuable information which we used to iterate and improve on the design prior to our full launch, and it served as a valuable precedent for future research projects. We were also able to develop a previously absent rapport with our users; we responded to each and every piece of feedback we received, engaging directly with the people who used the product, and giving them the opportunity to contribute to the development of the product.","methodImages":[],"results":"Overall it is no understatement that this project was a resounding success. It was well-received by both users and stakeholders and has enabled us to work on the NewsNow site more efficiently and effectively than was previously possible. Also, we embarked on some very large-scale design and development projects which have been facilitated by the new design system and its ability to evolve naturally and holistically with each update.\n\nAdditionally, the research and user-engagement measures undertaken within this project have helped to inform various subsequent projects, and paved the way for further rounds of user interviews, the development of user personas, and user demographic initiatives. User satisfaction metrics climbed steadily during my time at NewsNow.\n\nGiven the opportunity to do it again, I believe the project could have benefitted from a more thorough preliminary user research phase, to gather clear and identifiable pain points in the existing UX, and potentially free up some of the initial restrictions surrounding legacy styles and layout, by way of being able to make informed decisions and improve upon the existing formula. Further to this, I would have liked to have set OKRs from the outset, based on such knowledge, to better evaluate the outcomes of the project. \n\nThat said, NewsNow's New Format is by far the largest, most complex, and highest quality piece of work I've accomplished to date. It was a fantastic opportunity to rapidly and thoroughly expand my skills in UX, design, product management, and javascript development all at once, over the course of an intensive two years. \n\nThe New Format is still currently in private beta, but I hope it will launch soon.","toc":[],"body":{"type":"root","children":[]},"text":"","dir":"/work/case-studies","path":"/work/case-studies/newsnows-new-format","extension":".md","createdAt":"2023-06-29T15:25:31.191Z","updatedAt":"2023-06-29T15:25:31.191Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1688052473112},"$loki":21},{"slug":"three-vs-tinder","description":"A collaboration between Three and Tinder on a campaign concept where Henry VIII used Tinder to find his wives","meta_description":"A collaboration between Three and Tinder on a campaign concept where Henry VIII used Tinder to find his wives","summary":"During my role at BPL Marketing, we were approached by long-time client Three to produce a promotional landing page for their collaborative campaign with Tinder. The concept was based on juxtaposing smartphones with historical events, to explore comedic ways in which they might have turned out. In this case, Three and Tinder had built a campaign around King Henry VIII using Tinder to find his wives. We were briefed to build an interactive, promotional landing page for their digital marketing campaign, funneling users to a competition entry form where they could enter for the chance to win a Samsung Galaxy S9.","method":"We set about conducting brainstorming sessions with the wider creative team, and settled on the concept of \"The Swipe is Right\"; a play on words from the old game show *The Price is Right* and of course Tinder's swipe feature.\n\nOur solution was an interactive mini-game in which users would operate a Henry-VIII-themed version of the Tinder app, swiping through pictures of his six wives. Players would need to guess which of his wives survived, or were beheaded or divorced, by swiping in the correct direction for each to reach the end of the game and access the competition entry page.\n\nUsing both Three and Tinder's existing brand guidelines and campaign assets, I created the logo for *The Swipe is Right*, as well as wireframes, hi-fi designs, and prototypes in Figma, to test with stakeholders before commencing development. During this time we also firmed up the specifications for the functionality, such as allowing users who made incorrect choices to restart the game as many times as they wanted, to encourage conversions. Other members of the creative team worked on copywriting and other messaging, as well as the ad campaign to drive traffic to the landing page.\n\nOnce we had the design nailed down, we decided to use Vue.js for the front end of the page, as it would afford a high level of interactivity and was very unopinionated compared to other JS frameworks available at the time. I built the front end, alongside a back-end developer working in Laravel to handle the data, API, and security.","date":"2022","title":"Three vs Tinder","hero":"/img/hero-sr.jpg","thumb":"/img/thumb-sr.jpg","category":"SPA Design & Development","year":2017,"summaryImages":[{"src":"/img/three1_97da9f069a.jpg","caption":"Three vs Tinder: The Swipe is Right - State one"},{"src":"/img/three2_49565f9441.jpg","caption":"Three vs Tinder: The Swipe is Right - State two"},{"src":"/img/three3_ac8661b2d2.jpg","caption":"Three vs Tinder: The Swipe is Right - State three"},{"src":"/img/three4_b3507a1ac1.jpg","caption":"Three vs Tinder: The Swipe is Right - State four"},{"src":"/img/three5_113fa2fd61.jpg","caption":"Three vs Tinder: The Swipe is Right - State five"}],"results":"Overall this project was a great success.
